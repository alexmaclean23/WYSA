Programs:<br>
K - registration for co-ed Kindergarten soccer includes a size 3 soccer ball and Walpole shirt, plus clinic-style coaching for 9 or 10 weeks [fall & spring]. Each week the players get about 30 minutes of instruction, coached by WYSA [parent] coaches, assisted by professional coaches, and then finish with a small sided [4v4] game. Toward the end of each season we try to include a soccer Jamboree - no instruction that week - but the players have a chance to play several 4v4 games against other teams. In the Fall - Kindergarten program plays on Saturday afternoons. In the Spring - Kindergarten program plays on Sunday afternoons.<br><br>
1st & 2nd graders - clinic-style coaching for 9 or 10 weeks [fall & spring] - players get 45-60 minutes of instruction, coached by WYSA coaches [parents], assisted by professional coaches, and then we finish each week with small sided [4v4 or 5v5] games. Toward the end of each season we try to include a soccer Jamboree - no instruction that week - but the players have a chance to play several games against other teams. In the Fall - 1st & 2nd grade program plays on Saturday afternoons. In the Spring - 1st & 2nd grade program plays on Sunday afternoons.<br><br>
3rd graders - Limited Travel League. Spring - our 3rd grade teams participate in a local soccer league and play organized 7 vs 7 games against teams from other local towns, including Westwood, Medfield and Canton. Despite the game format, the emphasis is on intructional play, and learning. Games are typically on Saturdays, but Sundays are also a possibility. Most teams schedule practice once or twice mid-week, determined by the coach.<br><br>
4th grade, 5th grade, 6th grade and 7th & 8th grade (combined) teams - all play in the BAYS soccer league, which includes 55 towns in the metro-west area. These games are played on Saturdays, and we have a 10 week season. Girls games are typically in the mornings and Boys games are typically in the afternoons. Most teams practice twice a week for much of the season.<br><br>
** INTown - WYSA will provide each player with a WYSA Jersey. Players in Kindergarten soccer are provided a WYSA shirt and ball. Players in 1st and 2nd grade (our U8 program) will be provided a reversible soccer jersey which will need to be turned back in to the WYSA after the season or you will be charged a $35 replacement fee.<br><br>
